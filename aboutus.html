                    <h2>The Sugarlif Journey</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="about-us-para">
                    <h3>“Success is a journey, not a destination. The doing is often more important than the outcome.” —
                        Arthur Ashe</h3>
                    <p>The story of Sugarlif is not about the goal but its all about the journey it took. A journey to
                        achieve a goal which were intimidating, scary, like swimming in sea where the hope of many float
                        in nebulous future of someday. The beginning of the journey was also not less dramatic when
                        mother of a Juvenile Diabetic child made an emotional yet resolute appeal to Dr. Nandagopalan
                        asking, “Can you make my son to eat sweets?”; this emotional appeal triggered the research and
                        development of this revolutionary product. It took them 4 years to achieve a breakthrough with
                        the development of Low GI Sugar. The palpable happiness in the face of the mother and her
                        diabetic child was the Oscar for their effort. What is more pleasing is that they are consuming
                        it till date.</p>

                    <p>However, like any journey the innovators also faced certain hinderance and heart breaks. In 2011
                        they
                        joined hands with a Company called Diabliss Consumer Products Pvt Limited co-owned by Mr
                        Ramanathan
                        to manufacture and market the product made of this technology. Between 2011 to 2017 they jointly
                        conducted many tests and clinical study with the product made from this technology.</p>
                    <p>However, this partnership couldn’t last long as Diabliss didn’t honour the multiple commitments
                        they
                        made, and they parted ways in 2017.</p>
                    <p><b>“We now believe Diabliss started manufacturing Low Gi Sugar with some other technology and we
                            have
                            made it very clear to them that we don’t stand any guarantee for their product and its
                            efficacy”.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the year 2015 Dr. C.K. Nandagopalan and his team in Revolution joined hands with Natural Life
                        and
                        started a brand called Sugarlif and jointly dedicated their focus on getting international
                        validation for their technology and product. They got the product certified in Canada, USA,
                        Australia, India and at the same time committed their efforts to successfully find a way to make
                        this technology scalable to meet the global demand. We feel privileged and proud to be
                        recognised
                        among the pioneers in Low Gi Technology.</p>
                    <p>Today, this technology is owned by Natural Life Speciality Pvt Ltd. and we believe this is just a
                        beginning of a efficacious and flourishing journey</p>
